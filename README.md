- i made this because I didn't want to have to do MAD calculation in class. yes that's 8th/9th grade math(idk which). yes. i was 13.
- lookin back i'm pretty proud of this cuz it was something i coded that actually automated something in my life.
- im suprised this was 300+ lines. im not a concise coder. maybe ill try to fix that later. 
- i added termcolor because I thought that made my program look cooler, but now i think it's impractical because if I wanted to make that an executable, python can't 
really add the colors(or at least from a test). 
- feel free to use this for ur math. if you chnage the code lemme know abt it. I'd like to see what could be done with this!
